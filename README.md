## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with custom properties (Still Holding back on the tempation to use SASS)
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot during my second project. Still working to set-up an effective workflow. I didn't look at the previous project because I learn more doing this 'The Hard Way'. Yet I still struggle a bit with layout need to Google / Lookup basic things. I did my first CSS transitions and button shadow.  

```css
.container__text__button {
    width: 13rem;
    background-color: var(--HeaderColor);
    color: var(--Violet);
    border-style: none;
    box-shadow: 0px 3px 5px 3px var(--ButtonShadow);
    border-radius: 1.25rem;
    margin-bottom: 3.5rem;
    padding: 0.625rem;
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-weight: 300;
    transition: all 0.1s ease-in-out 0s;
}
```
### Continued development

My focus was on getting the responsive to be smooth and pleasant and be close to pixel 'perfect'. Also wanted to use transitions and correct colours, using a picker if needed to get the right hex value. Also want to use the Dev tools more to test assumptions and tweak the layout before I convert them to HTML / CSS.
